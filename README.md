Purpose: 
Implement either nearest neighbor or Gaussian Kernel density estimation. This should include include:
    - Simulate a dataset sampled from some function in a real-valued variable (you can use any previous HW or project, 1D is fine)
    - Estimate the density of this dataset using either method.
    - Draw your estimate and the dataset together. What values of the density estimator parameters seem to give the "best" results?
